# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to assist Bobby, Pewlett Hackard's HR analyst, build an employee database with SQL by using data modeling, engineering and analysis skills. This company has several thousand employees and they're offering retirement packages for employees that meet the specified criteria. They're looking to the future to prepare for the positions that will need to be filled in the near future because of upcoming retirements. 

## Results 
Below are four major points from the two analysis deliverables. 
- The retiring titles table shows there are 133,776 employees within retirement range, Jan 1, 1952 - Dec 31, 1955. 
- The 1st highest retiring title is Senior Engineer with 25,916 employees. 
- The 2nd highest retiring title is Senior Staff with 24,926 employees. 
- We found there are 1,549 employees that are eligible for mentorship. 

## Summary 
In the first wave of the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact, 1,549 roles will need to be filled. 
Since the highest retiring titles are Senior staff, there should be enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees.
